# Objective/Overview

The objective of this project is to use neural network with keras to solve regression problem in Python and R. This project is originally done in Python in Deep Learning with Keras, from Antonio Gulli and Sujit Pal, Keras regression example - predicting benzene levels in the air. Here we also do with R with some improvision.

This section executes purple part of the project flow shown in the figure below in R.
